## Using this repository to [follow the screencast][video]

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/Touch-Theming.git

Change into the directory:

    cd Sencha-Touch-Touch-Theming

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 00_blank_slate origin/00_blank_slate
    git checkout -b 01_default_theme origin/01_default_theme
    git checkout -b 02_enhanced_theme origin/02_enhanced_theme
    git checkout -b 03_multi_theme origin/03_multi_theme
